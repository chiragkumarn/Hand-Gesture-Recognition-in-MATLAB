# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-in-MATLAB
This project is based on deep learning which recognizes the hand gestures and outputs the text based on the gesture.
Database collection code is to create the dataset of the images to be trained.
Train code is used for training the dataset and go through recursive training of a certain epoch number.
Testing is for testing the model by which we provide the gestures to the webcam in order to recognize.
